● Based on my analysis, here are the prompts you can use
   to grant me full permission to implement the backend 
  functionality:

  Grant Full Implementation Permission

  "I grant you full permission to implement the complete
   backend functionality for InterLink as outlined in   
  your analysis and todo list. You have permission to:  

  1. Create and modify all backend files including API       
  routes, middleware, services, and configuration files      
  2. Set up the .env file with placeholder values for        
  all required API keys (Supabase, email services, OAuth     
   providers)
  3. Install all necessary dependencies and update
  package.json files
  4. Configure the Express server to serve the frontend      
  and handle all API requests
  5. Implement all database operations using Supabase        
  client
  6. Set up file upload capabilities using Supabase
  Storage
  7. Create all API endpoints for user management,
  client management, projects, messaging, inquiries, and     
   analytics
  8. Add proper error handling, logging, and security        
  middleware
  9. Document everything in backend .md files after each     
   major step
  10. Commit changes to git after each important
  milestone with descriptive commit messages
  11. Make any necessary changes to the frontend
  configuration to work with the backend server
  12. Test and debug all functionality to ensure
  everything works properly

  Please proceed with full implementation without asking     
   for permission at each step. Only ask for 
  clarification if you encounter critical decisions that     
   could significantly impact the architecture or if you     
   need actual API keys/credentials from me.

  Optional: API Keys and Services Preferences

  "For external services, please use:
  - Email Service: [SendGrid]        
  - File Storage: Supabase Storage (already configured)      
  - OAuth Providers: Google, Facebook (already partially       
  set up)
  - Rate Limiting: [your preference for rate limiting        
  service]"
