# üöÄ InterLink Deployment Guide

## Architecture Overview
- **Frontend**: Netlify (Next.js)
- **Backend**: Railway (Express.js)
- **Database & Auth**: Supabase

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Supabase Configuration ‚úÖ
- [x] Database tables created
- [x] Row Level Security (RLS) policies configured
- [x] Auth providers configured (Google, GitHub, Facebook)
- [x] API keys generated

### 2. Domain Configuration
- [ ] Update OAuth redirect URLs in Supabase
- [ ] Configure Resend domain (optional)

## üîß Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Deploy Backend to Railway

1. **Create Railway Project**
   ```bash
   # Install Railway CLI
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   
   # Login to Railway
   railway login
   
   # Deploy from backend directory
   cd backend
   railway up
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables in Railway**
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=8000
   SUPABASE_URL=
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
   RESEND_API_KEY=
   FROM_EMAIL=
   FROM_NAME=
   FRONTEND_URL=
   CORS_ORIGIN=
   JWT_SECRET=
   JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=
   ```

3. **Get Railway URL**
   - Copy your Railway app URL (e.g., `https://your-app-name.railway.app`)

### Step 2: Deploy Frontend to Netlify

1. **Update netlify.toml**
   ```toml
   [build]
     command = "cd frontend && npm run build"
     publish = "frontend/.next"

   [[redirects]]
     from = "/api/*"
     to = "https://your-railway-backend.railway.app/api/:splat"
     status = 200
     force = true
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables in Netlify**
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-railway-backend.railway.app
   ```

3. **Deploy to Netlify**
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Set build command: `cd frontend && npm run build`
   - Set publish directory: `frontend/.next`

### Step 3: Update Supabase Configuration

1. **Update OAuth Redirect URLs**
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí URL Configuration
   - Add your Netlify URL: `https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app/auth/callback`

2. **Update Site URL**
   - Set Site URL: `https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app`

## üß™ Testing Deployment

### Backend Health Check
```bash
curl https://your-railway-backend.railway.app/health
```

### Frontend Functionality
- [ ] OAuth login works
- [ ] Contact form submission works
- [ ] API calls succeed
- [ ] User registration works

## üîí Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit `.env` files
   - Use different keys for production
   - Rotate API keys regularly

2. **CORS Configuration**
   - Set specific origins in production
   - Remove wildcard origins

3. **Rate Limiting**
   - Already configured in backend
   - Monitor API usage

## üìä Monitoring & Logging

1. **Railway Logs**
   - Monitor application logs
   - Set up alerts for errors

2. **Supabase Dashboard**
   - Monitor database performance
   - Track authentication usage

3. **Netlify Analytics**
   - Monitor frontend performance
   - Track user engagement

## üîß Post-Deployment Updates

1. **Update Backend Environment**
   ```bash
   # Update Railway environment variables
   railway variables set CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app
   railway variables set FRONTEND_URL=https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app
   ```

2. **Update Frontend Environment**
   ```bash
   # Update Netlify environment variables
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-railway-backend.railway.app
   ```
